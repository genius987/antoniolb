I'm not afraid of death; I just don't want to be there when it happens.
Do one thing every day that scares you.
There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure. 
Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgement that
something else is more important than fear.
Im intimidated by the fear of being average

I froze. My throat constricted. I could hear the blood pounding in my ears. Every muscle in my body screamed at me to flee, but I remained frozen.

I don't know if these are good. Just searching my mind for anything I can think of to describe a person's plight when they're terrified.

1. I felt the muscles of my heart tighten with incredible force, sending gushes of blood down my veins in a single movement. (When you're shocked I guess? e.g. the moment that you hear that your family member has been in a serious accident.)

2. My breath quickened and I used every muscle in my body to stifle a whimper. (When the character is perhaps in a situation where she is hiding from someone/something.)

3. My limbs went numb with absolute fear. (Pretty straightforward)

Other, pretty cliche phrases:
"Sent shivers down my spine"
"Hairs on my body stood on an end"
"Heart began to hammer against my chest"
