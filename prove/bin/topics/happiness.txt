Happiness is not a reward  it is a consequence.
Happiness is different from pleasure. Happiness has something to do with struggling and enduring and accomplishing.?
Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.?
Happiness is not something you experience, it's something you remember.
Happiness is not a station you arrive at, but a manner of traveling.?
Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace and gratitude.
All in all, I would say that happiness is a decision. Your happiness is your decision to make. All the quotes above require actions on our part and actions require decisions.
So what do you think?
What is happiness?


Happiness is something everyone wants to have. You may be successful and have a lot of money, but without happiness it will be meaningless.
That's why I'm excited with this month's theme of Happiness. We will discuss this topic all month long and I'm sure we will learn a lot. But, before we move further, it's a good idea to get deeper understanding of the word happiness itself. Understanding what happiness is will give us good ground upon which to build our discussions.
Let me start with an official definition. According to Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, here is the definition of happiness:
a state of well-being and contentment
a pleasurable or satisfying experience

This definition is a good starting point and we can dig deeper from it. The best way to do that is to consult some of the greatest minds in history. So I researched what these people say about happiness and found 10 essential definitions. Each of them has deep meaning. Take your time to absorb it.
Here they are:
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.?
Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's values.?
Happiness is something that you are and it comes from the way you think.?
Happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere, wholeheartedly, one-directionally, without regret or reservation.?



For some people happiness is something they've never feel. For others it's a journey. Many people see happiness as the ultimate goal in life. So what is happiness? What is special about been a happy person? And finally How can you find happiness and become a happy person.
Most people who are truly happy have a true sense of purpose in their life. What is your passion and are you living it? For many people, faith in God brings them happiness, hope for the future and a sense of purpose.
Happy people generally are giving people; giving truly does bring the giver joy, if it's done with a real attitude of giving for the sake of giving. Happy people are also thankful for the things in their life, and for the people and relationships in their life. Nurture your special relationships with family and friends and think about dumping negative relationships that do nothing except bring you down.
Optimism doesn't come naturally to some people, but the happiest people are optimists, always looking on the lighter and brighter side of life. Take it easy on yourself-lighten up!
If you are online often, have a joke-of-the-day sent to you. ' be afraid to laugh; laughing releases endorphins in your brain that make you truly happy-as does exercise.
Consciously look for the bright side in every situation throughout the day; instead of instantly thinking something won't work, think about how it could.
Be thankful for people who are around you. Be thankful to god who gives you this life. And don't forget to live each moment of your life as the last one.

Happiness:

Something that can only be truly accomplished through being with the one you care for most, and can love more than anyone else. A rare feeling, one that has been sought after for many years, but that only a select few ever find. Although it is easy to be led astray by false happiness such as money or power, careful examination and dedicated persistence will guide you to true happiness.
I finally realized that she was right beside me all along, and now that we're together, I've found true happiness at last...

happiness is a state of mind with no external cause, it's a thought and a feeling stemming from one's love, understanding and respect for their own precious existence, inner beauty and worth. 

As for me, I picture happiness as a crystal clear spring or a river, that flows through me without a begining nor an end... life stretches itself on the banks of that river. No mundane stuff could either increase, or diminish my happiness, since I'm the master of my life and I'm in charge. I like pretty gals, fast cars, delicious meals, nice clothes and this kind of things the planet can offer; I do not like poverty, pain, tears, sadness and this kind of things the planet can offer. Here's the world: it's pleasurable or painful, it's sunny or cloudy, it's happy or not. And here's me: always feeling the pleasure of existence, always sunny, for always happy. Right, I'm in a good mood because I'm happy, not vice versa.
Dude: How could I be happy? I've just lost my true soul mate, I loved her so much! Now she's not here anymore. 



A rare and sought-after emotion of warmth and joy. Although it is in huge and ever-growing demand, there has never been an attempt to put a proper market value on it nor has there been any attempt to sell it retail.
"Happiness is my goal."
What happens when you're waiting for the novelty to wear off

Happiness is a brief period of pleasure and joy followed by greater misery and pain ahead...it is a sick vicious cycle until we die then we may find absolute happiness or absolute misery. 
The same logic applies to luck.
I became a rich person and had it all...I was on top of the world, then suddenly...BAM! My world fell apart on me and now I am miserable!

the emotion that occurs when you finally come on top after a struggle in your life, usually doesn't last long.
you've never tasted true happiness if you've never had a big struggle in your life.
Happiness quite unshared can scarcely be called happiness; it has no taste.

t's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will.

Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get

Sanity and happiness are an impossible combination.

I've got nothing to do today but smile.

Hope
Smiles from the threshold of the year to come, 
Whispering 'it will be happier'

Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.

The only way to find true happiness is to risk being completely cut open.

You cannot protect yourself from sadness without protecting yourself from happiness.

Promise Yourself

To be so strong that nothing
can disturb your peace of mind.
To talk health, happiness, and prosperity
to every person you meet.

To make all your friends feel
that there is something in them
To look at the sunny side of everything
and make your optimism come true.

To think only the best, to work only for the best,
and to expect only the best.
To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others
as you are about your own.

To forget the mistakes of the past
and press on to the greater achievements of the future.
To wear a cheerful countenance at all times
and give every living creature you meet a smile.

To give so much time to the improvement of yourself
that you have no time to criticize others.
To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,
and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.

To think well of yourself and to proclaim this fact to the world,
not in loud words but great deeds.
To live in faith that the whole world is on your side
so long as you are true to the best that is in you

Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.

If you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.

Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you

Let us dance in the sun, wearing wild flowers in our hair..

Talking about someone who makes you happy actually makes you happy

Here I am going to say something which may come as a bit of a shock. God doesn't necessarily want us to be happy. He wants us to be lovable. Worthy of love. Able to be loved by Him. We don't start off being all that lovable, if we're honest. What makes people hard to love? Isn't it what is commonly called selfishness? Selfish people are hard to love because so little love comes out of them.

I'd rather be miserable loving you than happy with anyone else

You can turn off the sun, but im still ganna shine!
